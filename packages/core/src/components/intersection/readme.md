# Intersection
This component provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's [viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Viewport). Its basic behavior is totally similar to [standard intersection observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). Its callback is executed whenever intersects with the viewport, or when the amount by which the two intersect changes by a requested amount.
