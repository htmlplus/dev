# Browser Support

`{Constants.PLATFORM_NAME}` supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms, including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer. We provide a small polyfill to help developers who use browsers which don't handle native support. `{Constants.PLATFORM_NAME}` uses an efficient mechanism that loads the polyfill just only when it's required.
